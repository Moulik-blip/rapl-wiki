## Introduction

**_Anyone who has an experience of company training knows how tedious it is to get one-self to go through the unengaging sessions and retain whatever it is that has been discussed a few hours back._**

At RapL, we don’t just believe that learning should be engaging, interactive and bite sized, we know how much it is effective too. Its normal to have knowledge retention to 20% but with Microlearning this pushes past 90%. And that is where RapL comes in with the Mantra ‘Micro-Learning Reinforced’. Based on the principle ‘Less is more’, our approach is as long as necessary & as short as possible.

Your learnings are revisited and retested till the knowledge gaps are bridged and you are an expert in the topic. Our flipped and confidence-based learning model is presented via real scenarios which makes learning fun plus engaging. The AI driven learning added with adaptiveness and personalization allows you to skip concepts you already know and focus on the weaker aspects handing you the control of your learning pace. Learning is now possible without disrupting the working shifts, because 3-5 mins spent on this mobile front approach where neither location nor language is a constraint helps you strengthen and retain your knowledge base. 

## Vision

**_In today’s fast-paced, distracting, and multitasking world, how will you stay ahead in the game of corporate learning and personal development?_**

With an aim of empowering each one of you to be your best, we started our journey and have accelerated business impact via a learning and development approach. Our Vision remains to drive the bottom line of businesses irrespective of the domain it belongs to.

**_We space out your learning, so you remember more even if you spent less time for it!_**

Along with experiencing an immersive learning, you will also be rewarded in the process via points and achievement badges.
